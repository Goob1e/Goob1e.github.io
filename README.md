My GitHub account was created for school assignments and maybe a little bit of personal coding for fun.	

The repository I made is going to be for my main assignments that I will be submitting.

The steps I completed to clone my repository are as follows,
	I created my initial repository
	Downloaded the github desktop app
	Chose the clone repository tab on the left hand side
	Created a GitHub Folder on my Hard drive
	Selected Clone repository
